  What goes into Hachyderm moderation?
---

## Hachydermians

**Hachydermians are responsible for their own actions.** This means:

1. Each Hachydermian is responsible for following server rules
(and relevant laws).
1. Each Hachydermian is responsible for ensuring that their
   participation in the fediverse is collaboratively aligned.
1. Each Hachydermian acknowledges that it is our collective
   responsibility to create and steward the interactions we want to
   see.
1. Each Hachydermian is responsible for their own learning and growth.

## Moderators (of Hachyderm)

**Moderators are responsible for stewarding safe spaces by
enforcing good conduct.** This means:

1. "Good conduct" here means "following server rules and local
laws."
1. Moderators acknowledge that it is to the benefit of all to
optimize on maximizing each user's ability to interact with as
much of the fediverse as possible.
1. Moderators acknowledge that some users are more vulnerable than
other users. Who is most vulnerable will be situationally
dependent based on the intersectionality at play.
1. Moderators acknowledge that while intent matters, we can only
act based on the impact of a user's actions.
1. Moderators take ownership of balancing open federation with
protecting the most vulnerable for all situations that fall under
our scope.
1. Moderators take ownership of protecting Hachyderm as the scope
of moderation, which means using the tools and resources we have
available for Hachydermians interacting in the fediverse and the
fediverse interacting with Hachydermians.

Note that Moderators, in this case, are viewing all users in an
interaction and not only the Hachydermians involved. The
implications of this will be covered in the rest of this document.

## Moderation of Hachyderm

Moderation action is required when a user's actions puts that
user's ability to openly federate in conflict with the moderators'
responsibility to protect the most vulnerable. What this means in
practice will depend on many factors. The questions the moderators
will need to answer in each scenario are:

- Is this a first incident or a repeated incident?
- What is the impact of this incident?
- Who is (or are) the most vulnerable in this situation?
- What are the limits of our ability to moderate this situation?

To elaborate, depending on whether an incident is a user's first
incident and the severity of the incident itself will determine
the course of moderator action. The types of actions that
moderators can take are based on the tools provided by Mastodon.
These include:

1. For Hachydermians, i.e. those with accounts on our server:
   - Warn, etc.
2. For individual non-Hachydermians, i.e. those on the fediverse
not based on Hachyderm:
   - Limit, etc.
3. For servers on the fediverse:
  - Commonly understood as The Blocklist

We have more detail on what moderators see when we receive reports
in our [Reporting](../reporting) article,
