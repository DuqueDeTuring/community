  What goes into Hachyderm moderation?

## Hachydermians

**Hachydermians are responsible for their own actions.** This means:

1. Each Hachydermian is responsible for following server rules
(and relevant laws).
1. Each Hachydermian is responsible for ensuring that their
   participation in the fediverse is collaboratively aligned.
1. Each Hachydermian acknowledges that it is our collective
   responsibility to create and steward the interactions we want to
   see.
1. Each Hachydermian is responsible for their own learning and growth.

## Moderators (of Hachyderm)

**Moderators are responsible for stewarding safe spaces by
enforcing good conduct.** This means:

1. "Good conduct" here means "following server rules and local
laws."
1. Moderators acknowledge that it is to the benefit of all to
optimize on maximizing each user's ability to interact with as
much of the fediverse as possible.
1. Moderators acknowledge that some users are more vulnerable than
other users. Who is most vulnerable will be situationally
dependent based on the intersectionality at play.
1. Moderators acknowledge that while intent matters, we can only
act based on the impact of a user's actions.
1. Moderators take ownership of balancing open federation with
protecting the most vulnerable for all situations that fall under
our scope.
1. Moderators take ownership of protecting Hachyderm as the scope
of moderation, which means using the tools and resources we have
available for Hachydermians interacting in the fediverse and the
fediverse interacting with Hachydermians.

Note that Moderators, in this case, are viewing all users in an
interaction and not only the Hachydermians involved. The
implications of this will be covered in the rest of this document.

## Moderation of Hachyderm

Moderation action is required when a user's actions puts that
user's ability to openly federate in conflict with the moderators'
responsibility to protect the most vulnerable. What this means in
practice will depend on many factors. The questions the moderators
will need to answer in each scenario are:

- Is this a first incident or a repeated incident?
- What is the impact of this incident?
- Who is (or are) the most vulnerable in this situation?
- What are the limits of our ability to moderate this situation?

To elaborate, depending on whether an incident is a user's first
incident and the severity of the incident itself will determine
the course and reversibility of moderator action. The types of actions that
moderators can take are based on the tools provided by Mastodon.
These include:

FIXME to expand 

1. For Hachydermians, i.e. those with accounts on our server:
   - Warn, etc.
2. For individual non-Hachydermians, i.e. those on the fediverse
not based on Hachyderm:
   - Limit, etc.
3. For servers on the fediverse:
   - Commonly understood as The Blocklist

We have more detail on what moderators see when we receive reports
in our [Reporting Document](../reporting), but essentially what
moderation actions can and should be taken depends on the source
that is being reported.

It is also important to understand that users _not_ based on
Hachyderm are not bound by the Hachyderm server rules. What this
means is that moderators will only take action on off-server
interactions that 1 ) are reported and 2 ) compromise safe space. To put it another way,
although Hachyderm has a rule limiting the number of corporate
accounts, we do not prevent Hachydermians from engaging with
corporate accounts on other servers. The same holds true for bots
and other account types that have different rules here.
Hachydermians participating with other individuals on the
fediverse, or with the accounts of entities and bots, is all fine. We would only take
action when those engagements infringe on safe spaces, e.g. if the
other user or entity is engaging in transphobic or anti-Black
actions, violating laws, or risking / at risk of compromising the
integrity of the Hachyderm infrastructure (accounts or servers as
attack vectors).

Moderators see all reports filed by Hachydermians to other servers
as well as receive all reports filed against
Hachydermians. This is covered in more detail in the
[Reporting Document](../reporting). What this does is allow us to
limit or prevent federating with either individual accounts or
domains of services that are infringing either on Hachyderm as a
safe space or Hachyderm's infrastructure. As you can see from the
short list above, moderators _cannot_ send warnings to users of
other instances: they are not bound by our rules. If we see a
report for a user that is not in violation of Hachyderm as a safe
space, does not violate any laws, and does not infringe on Hachyderm's
ability to operate, we leave the moderation action to the reported user's
home instance and do not take additional moderator action.

## Disabusing the Openness "Paradox"

FIXME - run on sentence

The "Paradox of Tolerance", here referred to as the "Openness
Paradox" (as a reference to open federation), can be summarized
as: tolerance without limit necessarily includes tolerance of intolerance.
Discussion of this usually goes a bit further, as there are
consequences of intolerance, both throughout history and in every
day life, with consequences of varying degrees. (Full discussion
of this exceeds the scope of this article, but for additional
reading start with [The Paradise of
Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)
Wikipedia page.)

Succinctly: Hachyderm is not open for openness' sake and is not
unlimitedly so. Moderators take ownership to keep Hachyderm **_as open as possible_**;
however, we will put limits on openness to protect Hachydermians,
full stop.

## Over- vs Under- representation

This section will start with a familiar scenario: the senior
engineer at a tech company. To keep the scenario simple, we'll say
"small company". Certain duties fall to the most senior
engineer(s), many of which can be categorized as communication and/or
education. They may onboard new engineers that are either less
experienced than they are or who are their peers ("new" to company,
not "new" to industry). They make and communicate decisions to
their peers, subordinates, and management layers.

The number of engineers functioning at this level is usually
limited. It takes time and study to grow in a field of expertise
and engineering is no different. That means in general there are
"more" level I engineers than level II, "more" level II than level
III, and so forth. ("More" being flexible in exact value.) What
_can_, and frequently _does_, happen is when there's not a good
headcount ratio is that the more senior engineers get burned out
by the demands on their time.

### What does this have to do with over- / under- representation?

One of the most significant factors for the burnout was called out
directly: headcount. That is to say, "too many of them and not
enough of me".

We all learn from each other. Each Hachydermian, moderator,
maintainer, and user, acknowledges that for any given
demographic there is going to be the "too many of you and too few
of me" problem. Specifically: historically underrepresented groups
quite directly suffer from the "too many of them, too few of me"
problem when interacting with historically overrepresented groups.
That means by default those who are underrepresented have already
learned to interact with those who are overrepresented, but those
who are overrepresented have not necessarily learned how to
interact with those who are underrepresented.

In order to equitably share the burden of shared learning and
growth, each Hachydermian acknowledges that some
intersectionalities will spend a _lot_ of energy educating those
outside their own demographic(s). This includes but is not limited
to: what is it like to be Black? What is it like to be chronically
ill? What is it like to be ....?

Part of being a Hachydermian is that we make a promise to do our
best by each other and that we will do our due dilligence to learn
and grow by pursuing our own research and not disproportionately
place the burden of education on others. Succintly: we will
"google" both to develop a broader awareness of our world as well
as "what the _heck_ is Java throwing Exceptions over now???" **We
will also always show appreciation for, but not expectation of, the time that those who
choose to educate give as education is a gift and time is a
gift.** (Especially since, relevantly, it is likely that person's 50th time
having that conversation even if it is your first.)
