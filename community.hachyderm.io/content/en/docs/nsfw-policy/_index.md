  This is a clarification for NSFW and 18+ content.

Currently, Mastodon does not allow users to:

1. Specify that they are 18 or over
1. Mark that content is specifically 18+ or otherwise NSFW

Content Warnings, as a feature, _do_ help by allowing users
to make use of warnings to obscure text and visual media
with an explanation. That said, by itself the Content
Warning feature does _not_ comply with what is legally
required to prevent minors from seeing content the law
considers to be 18+.

Since Hachyderm is geared for adult professionals, in order
to be legally compliant and accommodate the limitation in the
Mastodon tools, servers deemed to be 18+ will be either Limited
or set to Reject Media.
