  How to fund Hachyderm and our sponsor list.
---

## Thank you to various donors and sponsors!

### What's this page about?

Aside from the Nivenly memberships that are going to be released
in 2023, Hachyderm is funded by many direct donations. Some donors
opt-in to being listed here on our Thank You page. Please check
back throughout 2023 to see as we add more names and information!

### How do I help support Hachyderm?

Hachyderm is currently running on donations to [Kris NÃ³va's Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/krisnovalive) page;
however, we are in the process of setting up a new process that is more accessible / does not require
separate account creation.

#### Note for prior Ko-Fi sponors

We're rolling out the Thank You page starting in March 2023. If
you donated via Ko-Fi prior to that time and would like to appear
on this list, please email the admins after 1 Mar 2023, which is
when we'll start to reconcile the donation lists.
