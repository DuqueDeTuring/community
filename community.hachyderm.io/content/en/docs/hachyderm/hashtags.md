  How to use hashtags on the Fediverse, including reserved hashtags.
---

Hashtags are useful ways of connecting with other users. When users
follow hashtags they can see posts that might otherwise be buried
in the firehose of their local and/or federated timelines.


## Hashtag Ettiquette <!-- omit from toc -->

There are a few aspects to how use hashtags:

- [Use common hashtags](#use-common-hashtags)
- [CamelCase your hashtags](#camelcase-your-hashtags)
- [Don't overuse hashtags](#dont-overuse-hashtags)
- [Don't misuse reserved hashtags](#dont-misuse-reserved-hashtags)
  - [Fediverse reserved hashtags](#fediverse-reserved-hashtags)
  - [Hachyderm reserved hashtags](#hachyderm-reserved-hashtags)
  - [General use hashtags](#general-use-hashtags)
  - [Informational](#informational)
  - [Fun](#fun)

If you are looking for Hachyderm-specific hashtags, please look
at the Reserved Hashtags section linked above.

* Hashtags change organically
* Use common hashtags in your posts as applies
* CamelCase your hashtags
* Don't overuse hashtags
* Don't misuse reserved hashtags
  * Reserved hashtags may be Fediverse or instance specific

## Use common hashtags

Just like living languages, hashtags change. Cultural reference to a meaning
or phrase may shift over time, may increase or decrease in usage, or may just
be an inline joke in the post. Noting which hashtags are commonly associated
with post topics, either specific or broad, and using them <u>can help others</u>
who are either opting in or out of the type of content you are posting. (See 
[filtering content on our mental health doc](../mental-health/)). As a quick
example, someone looking to connect with other fountain pen users might follow
hashtags like pen, ink, or penthusiast. Likewise, someone who needs to filter
out food and/or drink related content for any reason, might filter out hashtags
like food, drink, DiningOut, and so forth.

## CamelCase your hashtags

You should always CamelCase your hashtags so that screen readers can read them
properly. ([Please see our Accessible Posts doc](../accessible-posts/)). Changing
the casing will _not_ change the posts that are attributed to the tag. This means
whether someone is filtering in or out based on the tag, the same posts will be
displayed or hidden.

If you are using a hashtag and a non-CamelCase option is offered to autocomplete,
please complete with CamelCase. This is because Mastodon will offer the most
common tag or tags associated with what you are writing. The more users manually
type the CamelCase version, the sooner the CamelCase tag is offered for autocomplete.

For completely new tags the tag is stored with the case provided. This is when
you should take additional care: the next person who types the tag after you
will be presented to autocomplete the version you have typed (as the only one
that exists).

## Don't overuse hashtags

It's reader discretion for how many tags are "too much". One or two will likely
be fine, and having every word be a separate hashtag is a chore to read. As a
loose rule, around five tags per post should be a reasonable "upper bound".

## Don't misuse reserved hashtags

What to know about reserved hashtags:

* Can only be used for their stated purpose
* Can be restricted across the Fediverse or instance-specific.
* Misuse of reserved hashtags may warrant moderator action, this will
  be on a case-by-case basis.

This means that these reserved hashtags cannot be used the same as general
purpose hashtags. For example, you can include cats and caturday on any
cat-relevant post you wish. You cannot use the FediBlock hashtag for any
other reason than to notify other instance admins of a malicious instance
or user.

### Fediverse reserved hashtags

In order for hashtags to be listed in this section, they must be shown to
be:

* Used across the Fediverse
* Extremely limited or narrow in scope
* TBD -> FIXME: need additional clarifying criteria to separate "reserved"
  from general use. Caturday is cross fediverse, but not reserved. If it
  doesn't pass the Caturday test, the criteria are incorrect or insufficient.
* Perhaps the only criteria is "will moderate for misuse"

* [FediBlock](https://hachyderm.io/tags/FediBlock)
  * Should **_only_** be used for updating the Fediverse about users and/or
    instance domains that need to be suspended via the instance admin tools.
  * This tag is followed by instance admins across the Fediverse and as such
    is not limited to Hachyderm or even Mastodon instances in general.
  * To see how to include the appropriate level of detail for posts with
    this tag, please see existing posts.
  * Misusing this tag is using it for _any other purpose_, e.g. jokes like 
    "lol #FediBlock ed".
* [FedHire](https://hachyderm.io/tags/FediHire)
  * Should **_only_** be used for job posting and job seeking.
  * To see how to include detail in posts, please see existing posts.

To append hashtags to the above list, please submit a PR or email us at
[admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io). In order for a tag to
be listed in this section, it must be shown to be reserved across the
Fediverse and not limited to a specific instance

### Hachyderm reserved hashtags

* [hachybots](https://hachyderm.io/tags/hachybots)
  * This tag is required for all bot posts on Hachyderm.
