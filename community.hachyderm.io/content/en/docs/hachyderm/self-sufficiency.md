  What makes a great "digital citizen" on Hachyderm?

FIXME - need to write out the following:

- Remember to block content that is triggering _to you_, so
  blocking hashtags, spoilers, traumatizing content
- We as mods can only moderate at the community level, users need
  to (to a point - clarify) moderate at the individual level.
