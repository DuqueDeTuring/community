## Social media and your mental health <!-- omit from toc -->

There are many articles available online about social media, general online
engagement, and mental health. This document is going to focus on a subset
of these and focus on helping you use the Mastodon tools to uphold your
personal needs and boundaries.

## Mastodon tools at your disposal 

Being online is a bit like being in a crowded room or stadium, depending on
the audience size. That means when you go to take a step back, you may need
to use some of the Mastodon tools to help you maintain the space you're trying
to create for yourself either temporarily or permanently. The user level tools
available are:

* Hiding boosts
* Following or unfollowing individual users
* Muting or blocking individual users
* Filtering keywords and hashtags to either follow or block/mute
  * Filters in particular can have an experation date or be permanent
* Hiding content via an entire server

How to use all of these features are on [Mastodon's Dealing with unwanted content doc page](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/).
Please refer to the documentation page for the implementation detail for each.

There are a few other features that are also available to you beyond the scope of
the Unwanted Content doc:

* Hiding your follows/followers
* Disabling autorefreshing pages (FIXME phrasing)
* Showing or hiding media
* Showing or hiding posts behind content warnings
* Other accessibility tools
  * FIXME: we should have a "user -> accessibility" page to compliment the above
* Control over who can / cannot DM you
* Account public / private / hidden

FIXME: These are documented by us in our user section.

## Common negative impacts and how to address them

There are a few patterns on social media that are detrimental to us as
individuals, even if there is a collective benefit.

### How and who can interact with your account

Follower/following, DMs, public vs private account

This is where you can control who can interact with your account and how they can
do so.

### Control what content you want to be exposed to

Filtering, etc. Display images or not, boosts or not, etc.

This is where you can control what content you are exposed to and either increase
or decrease certain types of content based on hashtags and keywords.

### Control what cadence (?)

Doomscrolling.

FIXME - make sure to pepper through / repeat the followng: preserve your mental health,
also report to mods when appropriate. This should not be used in lieu of reporting.

:warning:️ Self awareness -> know when to step away and what situations your prone to "stepping in to".

## Context Setting

There are situations where individual Hachydermians may need to create
space to preserve their mental health. Some common situations include
not limited to:

* When there content that you do not want to engage with in general, but
  is not in and of itself problematic.
* When there is an event in a news cycle, viral post, and so on that negatively
  impacts your mental health.
* When you don't want to see content from specific users, but the users
  themselves are not otherwise harmful or warranting moderation.

## Know when to engage the moderators

The goal of this doc is to help you create space for yourself when
on Hachyderm. The goal is not to avoid situations where users and
servers should be [reported to the moderator team](/docs/moderation/reports/).

## Creating space for yourself

It is important to use the tools available to you to your benefit. In the
context of creating mental and emotional space, or setting and maintaining
boundaries, there are 

FIXME - need to write out the following:

- Remember to block content that is triggering _to you_, so
  blocking hashtags, spoilers, traumatizing content
- We as mods can only moderate at the community level, users need
  to (to a point - clarify) moderate at the individual level.
- Hashtags - fedihire, feditips, fediblock, etc.
- Protecting your Online Experience / Mental Health might be a better phrasing


What you should do to protect your mental health:

- Don't doomscroll
  - Mastodon feature to assist with this?
- Don't engage with users that are negatively impacting your mental health
  - This means not going onto their threads to engage with them as well as
  - not responding when they engage with you.
  - This means setting boundaries for persisent people, and enforcing them
  - as needed (blocking, muting, etc.)
  - Just the whole "stepping away" thing.
- Report users and content that needs server-wide policy
  - The difference between "is this bad for me or is this bad for the community"
- For content that is "bad for me, fine for server":
  - Use block, mute, etc. to limit or prevent individual interactions
- Be mindful of whether your forwarding a report to another server's mods or not
  - In the cases of brigading, the domain is run by the same people you're reporting
  - and the report is an attack vector pointing them to you. You can always choose
  - to not forward a report.
- Interactions that do not go the way you intend note.
- Too many followers? Limit who can follow you by requiring them to request.
- Personal bounardaries are more about the software, know yourself
  - What topics are unsafe for you? How can you keep them away from you?
  - Unsafe / frustrating / traumatizing == avoid for any reason you wish
  - What topics do you frequently want to Fix Others Mindset on that Frequently
  - Results in Negative Experiences for you? -> Filter / block / mute, prevent temptation.
- Don't forget that unfollowing is an option along with block / etc.
- Can users prevent DMs? Can users individually prevent media from loading?
- That image about "Slack"tivism: online petition, social media posts, but no real change.
  - Change is change, if the person you are arguing with immediately changes their view,
  - is the negative consequence to you worth it for that interaction?
  - Does it move the social justice issue forward?
    - Yes, understood that it's a collective effort to shift collective minds, this is a
    - one off situation.
- Any statements on privacy: images of you, your pets, your home, your family, the usual PII warnings.
  - May exceed scope of this page, but these are frequent doxxing tactics. People can doxx
    pretty easily, actually.
- Self service: service to the self
