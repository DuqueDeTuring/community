## Social media and your mental health <!-- omit from toc -->

There are many articles available online about social media, general online
engagement, and mental health. This document is going to focus on a subset
of these and focus on helping you use the Mastodon tools to uphold your
personal needs and boundaries.

## Moderation action and individual action

As you navigate the Fediverse, you will frequently run into situations where you need
to decide if a situation can or should be handled by you individually, by the moderation team,
or both. When you are deciding which action(s) to take, the main question you should ask is:

> Is the discussion / interaction that I encountered something that I need to avoid
> for my own mental health or is it something that poses a community risk that needs to
> be handled by moderation?

A couple examples of discussions or interactions that would have a negative impact on the community:

* Any posts that are supporting or perpetuating racist, homophobic, transphobic, and other \*ist / \*phobic viewpoints.
* Any interactions where a user or users is targeting an individual or group for stalking and/or harassment.

A couple of examples of discussions that can have a positive impact on the community as a whole
but can have a negative impact on individuals:

* Posts sharing and discussing news cycles around individual or state violence,<br />
  even if they are condemning that violence.
  * Individuals and communities that are the current or historic target of that violence may be triggered.
* Posts about individual exposure to, or recovery from, various forms of trauma.
  * Individuals who have been exposed to the same, or similar, situations may be triggered.

The above examples are not comprehensive, but do show situations where you may need to protect
your own individual mental health even as communities across the Fediverse discuss and interact
in ways that show collective growth.

## Mastodon tools at your disposal 

Being online is a bit like being in a crowded room or stadium, depending on
the audience size. That means when you go to take a step back, you may need
to use some of the Mastodon tools to help you maintain the space you're trying
to create for yourself either temporarily or permanently. The user level tools
available are:

* Hiding boosts
* Following or unfollowing individual users
* Muting or blocking individual users
* Filtering keywords and hashtags to either follow or block/mute
  * Filters in particular can have an experation date or be permanent
* Hiding content via an entire server

How to use all of these features are on [Mastodon's Dealing with unwanted content doc page](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/).
Please refer to the documentation page for the implementation detail for each.

There are a few other features that are also available to you beyond the scope of
the Unwanted Content doc:

* Hiding your follows/followers
* Disabling autorefreshing pages
* Showing or hiding media
* Showing or hiding posts behind content warnings
* Control over who can / cannot DM you
* Account public / private / hidden
* Follows / Follwers either public or hidden

The above, and more, are documented on our [Mastodon User Profile and Preferences](/docs/mastodon/user/profile-preferences/).

## Common negative impacts and ideas to address them

FIXME - this needs to be moved to under the next section.

There are a few patterns on social media that are detrimental to us as
individuals, even if there is a collective benefit.

## Patterns to proactively protect your mental health

There are a few patterns that you can use to get ahead of posts that will negatively impact your
mental health.

### Give yourself permission

This is not a Mastodon tool, but a mindset. For anyone who wants or needs to have it stated:

* You can leave conversations at any time for any reason. You do not need to justify or inform when
  you do, especially if doing so will continue to inflame the situation.
* You can opt-out of any content at any time for any reason. You to not need to justify or inform
  when you do, especially if doing so will be negatively impactful to yourself.

About leaving conversations: contributing to change is a bit like general elections. There may be thousands, or
even millions, partaking in the election. The individual vote may be a grain of sand on a dune,
but the collective vote provides consensus (the shape of the dune). This means that while it is
important to have individual and collective conversations that improve the lives of yourself and
others, that _each individual_ conversation is the grain of sand and the _net benefit_ is the dune.
If a particular attempt at conversation to inspire change in someone else isn't doing so, and
especially if their response negatively impacts you, remember to walk away for any reason. There
will always be next time, with another grain of sand or the same one, and you do not need to
continue a current conversation that is ineffective and/or damaging.

About opting-out of content: some forms of content are community-beneficial and individually harmful.
This is especially true of conversations around news cycles, their impacts, and responses (including
protests and so forth). When you're a member of a group or community that is being targeted by another,
this means that you periodically inundated with Everyone's Thoughts, Opinions, and Questions About What To Do
at unpredictable times. While you may support the community supporting you, for your own mental health
you may want to not feel like you should partake in those conversations. In fact you may
even prefer to navigate social media as if those conversations aren't happening.

### Unwanted content: filtering via keywords, hashtags

### Setting healthy boundaries and protecting your personal information

### Creating some proactive boundaries

* for large accounts, accounts for people / communities that are at risk
* Auto-deleting posts after a certain period of time
  * Why there might be disagreement with this / disappearing / linked content

### Enforcing boundaries and what happens they're violated

First and foremost: it is not ok for someone to violate your boundaries or for you to
violate someone else's. To be clear, this section is _not_ for stalking and other forms
of harassment. If you are experiencing these, please [report it to the moderation team](/docs/moderation/reporting).

The common patterns you'll see here:

* When someone is asked to stop engaging in a topic of conversation, thread, or with someone else overall and they do not. e.g.:
  * "Please don't talk about TOPIC in this thread."
  * "Please don't continue to engage with this conversation."
  * "Please don't continue to engage with me."
* When a person who is a member of a community posts and clearly identifies an [in-group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_and_out-group)
  thread and non-members / out-group persons respond. e.g.:
  * "Black Mastodon users..." -> If you are not Black, do not respond.
  * "Non-native English speakers..." -> If your native language is English, do not respond.

For the latter: it is not feasiable for anyone to try and individually block or otherwise filter out who they
suspect is not a member of the in-group they are attempting to converse with. If you know that you are not
in the requested group, do not respond for any reason. If you do and you're a Hachydermian, you will be in
violation of our [Don't Be A Dick](/docs/rule-explainer) policy (at a minimum).

For the former, please read on.

##### Someone violating your boundaries <!-- omit from toc -->

If you have asked someone to stop engaging with you and/or a your thread, the main tools at
your disposal are:

* Mute the user<br />
  They will still be able to follow you and see your posts. They will not be notified they are muted.
* Block the user<br />
  They will not be able to follow you, see your posts, etc. They will not be notified that they are
  blocked, but they will be able to tell that they are blocked.

##### You're violating someone else's boundaries <!-- omit from toc -->

* TBD
* Apologize, step away. Whether you are right or they are, the conversation is not effective.


### How and who can interact with your account

Follower/following, DMs, public vs private account

This is where you can control who can interact with your account and how they can
do so.

### Control what content you want to be exposed to

Filtering, etc. Display images or not, boosts or not, etc.

This is where you can control what content you are exposed to and either increase
or decrease certain types of content based on hashtags and keywords.

### Control what cadence (?)

Doomscrolling.

FIXME - make sure to pepper through / repeat the followng: preserve your mental health,
also report to mods when appropriate. This should not be used in lieu of reporting.

:warning:️ Self awareness -> know when to step away and what situations your prone to "stepping in to".

## Context Setting

There are situations where individual Hachydermians may need to create
space to preserve their mental health. Some common situations include
not limited to:

* When there content that you do not want to engage with in general, but
  is not in and of itself problematic.
* When there is an event in a news cycle, viral post, and so on that negatively
  impacts your mental health.
* When you don't want to see content from specific users, but the users
  themselves are not otherwise harmful or warranting moderation.

## Know when to engage the moderators

The goal of this doc is to help you create space for yourself when
on Hachyderm. The goal is not to avoid situations where users and
servers should be [reported to the moderator team](/docs/moderation/reports/).

## Creating space for yourself

It is important to use the tools available to you to your benefit. In the
context of creating mental and emotional space, or setting and maintaining
boundaries, there are 

FIXME - need to write out the following:

- Remember to block content that is triggering _to you_, so
  blocking hashtags, spoilers, traumatizing content
- We as mods can only moderate at the community level, users need
  to (to a point - clarify) moderate at the individual level.
- Hashtags - fedihire, feditips, fediblock, etc.
- Protecting your Online Experience / Mental Health might be a better phrasing


What you should do to protect your mental health:

- Don't doomscroll
  - Mastodon feature to assist with this?
- Don't engage with users that are negatively impacting your mental health
  - This means not going onto their threads to engage with them as well as
  - not responding when they engage with you.
  - This means setting boundaries for persisent people, and enforcing them
  - as needed (blocking, muting, etc.)
  - Just the whole "stepping away" thing.
- Report users and content that needs server-wide policy
  - The difference between "is this bad for me or is this bad for the community"
- For content that is "bad for me, fine for server":
  - Use block, mute, etc. to limit or prevent individual interactions
- Be mindful of whether your forwarding a report to another server's mods or not
  - In the cases of brigading, the domain is run by the same people you're reporting
  - and the report is an attack vector pointing them to you. You can always choose
  - to not forward a report.
- Interactions that do not go the way you intend note.
- Too many followers? Limit who can follow you by requiring them to request.
- Personal bounardaries are more about the software, know yourself
  - What topics are unsafe for you? How can you keep them away from you?
  - Unsafe / frustrating / traumatizing == avoid for any reason you wish
  - What topics do you frequently want to Fix Others Mindset on that Frequently
  - Results in Negative Experiences for you? -> Filter / block / mute, prevent temptation.
- Don't forget that unfollowing is an option along with block / etc.
- Can users prevent DMs? Can users individually prevent media from loading?
- That image about "Slack"tivism: online petition, social media posts, but no real change.
  - Change is change, if the person you are arguing with immediately changes their view,
  - is the negative consequence to you worth it for that interaction?
  - Does it move the social justice issue forward?
    - Yes, understood that it's a collective effort to shift collective minds, this is a
    - one off situation.
- Any statements on privacy: images of you, your pets, your home, your family, the usual PII warnings.
  - May exceed scope of this page, but these are frequent doxxing tactics. People can doxx
    pretty easily, actually.
- Self service: service to the self
