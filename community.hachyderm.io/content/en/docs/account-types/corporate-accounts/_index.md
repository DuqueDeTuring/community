## Corporate Covenant

### What is a Corporate Account? Do I need one? Am I one?

The simplest way to determine if an account is a corporate account or not is to ask yourself if the entity that the account represents is trying to make a profit or not.
Chances are, if the entity is seeking profit, we are dealing with a corporate account. 
In other words if you intend to create an account for a business, you should read this document because this document is exclusively for people like you.

### Overview

- Corporate Hachyderm accounts **are by invitation only.**
- All corporate accounts must self-identify by placing their full legal
  corporation name as their display name.

#### How do I get my company invited?

At this time Hachyderm is not accepting any more corporate accounts for 2022.

Check back again in early January 2023 for more detail on the next wave of accounts.

## Covenant Guiding Principles

If you have been invited to have a Hachyderm corporate account we ask that you
understand and adhere to our guiding principles.

### 1. Be a Hachydermian: Fines Doubled In Work Zone

We expect you to set the bar for what it means to be a Hachydermian, and the
rules apply extra to you.

> I agree to be a steward and role model in the Hachyderm community. I
> understand that my presence as a corporation implies the rules will be more
> strictly applied to me than normal accounts.

The Hachyderm community is a diverse community comprised of many people with
many economic beliefs and situations.

We expect you to have a mature understanding of various economic structures
around the world, and find a strong balance in your position as a corporation.

In the Hachyderm community you will find strong capitalists and even anti-capitalists.
We expect you to consider these different perspectives while creating content
on Hachyderm.

As a corporate Hachydermian [our rules](https://Hachyderm.io/about/more#rules)
apply more to you than to the average user.
Which means the consequences of a rule violation applies more to you than others.
In other words your fines will be doubled if you end up violating our rules.
We will warn you first that you have violated a guiding principle, and if it
continues we will ask you to leave.

Ultimately you are setting the bar both for Hachyderm users, as well as the
exclusive corporate accounts.

### 2. Be The Corporation You Want To Work With

We expect you to do unto the community as you would have done unto you.

"Create the market you would want to shop at".

> I agree to build a market that I would want to shop at. I agree to set the
> bar for having world-class corporate engagement in Hachyderm.

We find value in drawing the analogy to forced advertising at the gas station.

As a gas station owner, forced messaging makes sense because of the higher
return on advertising.
As a gas station customer there is nothing more annoying that being forced to
listen to an ad while pumping gas.

We want people to want to shop at your gas station, which means you need to
consider their experience first.

We have high expectations for our community filling their cars with your
metaphorical gas.

### 3. Say It Once: "The Wikipedia" policy

Measuring spam is hard. We expect you to stay away from repetitive content.

> I agree to share new content and do my best to prevent repetitive content. I
> understand that words can be changed but messaging can remain consistent. I
> agree to only share my message once.

We don't have time to chase you around.

We find value in what Wikipedia calls [Use our own words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Use_our_own_words).

> The best practice is to research the most reliable sources on the topic and
> summarize what they say in your own words.

We understand that while technically not repeating the exact same words you can
deliver the same message.
We expect you to say your message once, and not repeat the same message time
and time again.

We are explicitly trying to avoid the "cron job" effect that we see on Twitter
with promotional accounts.
When in doubt, craft new words and form a new opinion. Otherwise it likely is
repetitive content.

In short we hold you to a high bar to be "the first of your kind", otherwise we
expect you to be contributing to the existing resource when applicable.

We don't want Hachyderm to turn into a promotional recycling center. You are
either sharing new content, or you should be mentioning the original source and
adding to it.

### 4. "We Know It When We See It" Policy

Ultimately the community comes first and the communities response to your
corporate content will be our guiding light.

> I understand that policies are difficult to enforce. If it is made obvious to
> me that Hachyderm is no longer benefiting from my presence I will politely
> step down as a corporate account and move to another server.

If your content becomes "invasive" or "unwanted" or seems to be causing
problems we will ask you to move your corporate account to another server.

Basically we look at "bad actors" like we look at pornography. We know it when
we see it. We reserve the right to ask you to leave at any time.

### 5. Mods are Volunteers, Not Product Marketing Police

The corporate account needs to be a win for everyone involved, including our
moderators.

> I understand that it is my job to self-moderate. If moderation from Hachyderm
> is involved we have failed twice. First in self-moderation, and 2nd in
> violating a specific policy.

Ideally a corporate account should be helping to keep bad actors out while also
setting an extremely high bar of what it means to be a good community member.

If at any time the Hachyderm moderators are spending more time chasing your
account around than our community is getting out of your presence, it's time to
go.

Our moderators are here to keep the community safe, not police your product
marketing.
