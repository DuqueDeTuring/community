## What is a Corporate Account

Corporate accounts are specialized accounts that apply to those running accounts for businesses
and business-like entities. Corporate accounts are invite only and, as of 1 Mar 2023, corporate
accounts will be restricted to Nivenly Corporate Members. Nivenly Corporate Members who wish to
create corporate accounts on Hachyderm will still need to agree to  [the covenant](../covenant/).

      an account is a registered / official account or not.

## Corporate account application information

Starting 1 Mar 2023, corporate accounts will be restricted to Nivenly Corporate Members. We are
handling corporate membership requests individually prior to that date, to set expectations of
what will be needed moving forward. We ask for our new and upcoming corporate accounts to please
be patient with us as we iron out our processes as part of the Nivenly Foundation's launch.

#### The Nivenly Foundation

[The Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org) is a non-profit co-op that we are creating to
house Hachyderm and Open Source Projects. One of the main aspects of Nivenly is governance:
we are building a multichamber model that will have members from the community, 
project maintainers, and the companies who choose to be Nivenly Corporate Members. For more
information about Nivenly itself, please refer to [Nivenly's website](https://nivenly.org)
over the course of 2023 as we go through our launch.
