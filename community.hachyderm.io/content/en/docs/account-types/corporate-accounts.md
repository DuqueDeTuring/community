## What is a Corporate Account

Corporate accounts are specialized accounts that apply to those running accounts for businesses
and business-like entities. Corporate accounts are invite-only and, as of 1 Mar 2023, corporate
accounts will be restricted to Nivenly Trade Members. Nivenly Trade Members who wish to
create corporate accounts on Hachyderm will still need to agree to the [Specialized Account Expectations](../covenant/).

## Rules and restrictions

- Corporate Account creation is restricted
  - After 1 Mar 2023, corporate accounts will be restricted to Nivenly Trade Members
  - Prior to 1 Mar 2023, corporate accounts were invite-only
  - Unofficial corporate accounts will be suspended
- Account rules
  - Corporate accounts must agree to the [Specialized Account Expectations](../covenant/) (formerly referred to as Corporate Covenant)
  - Corporate accounts must be verified with their company page
  - Corporate accounts must be [verified with Hachyderm](../verification/)
    - This last process is a new process in 2023, to help Hachyderm users quickly see if
      an account is a registered / official account or not.

## Corporate account application information

Starting 1 Mar 2023, corporate accounts will be restricted to Nivenly Trade Members. We are
handling corporate membership requests individually prior to that date, to set expectations of
what will be needed moving forward. We ask for our new and upcoming corporate accounts to please
be patient with us as we iron out our processes as part of the Nivenly Foundation's launch.

#### The Nivenly Foundation

[The Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org) will facilitate Hachyderm's governance as well as other open source projects.
The governance model will be democratic in nature, and all Nivenly Trade members will be given a vote in member level elections.
For more information see [nivenly.org](https://nivenly.org).
