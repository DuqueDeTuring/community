FIXME - In the same way that all the rules are calling out commont "whataboutisms"
for our primary rule "don't be a dick", the around specliazed accounts are to
prevent an on server shouting match.


We distinguish between 2 main types of accounts that we use to measure and
moderate here on Hachyderm: specialized accounts and user
accounts. (Specialized accounts are sometimes also referred to as
"novelty" accounts on other platforms.) User accounts are when
a single user is interacting with the platform as themselves and
not on behalf of a company (Company Inc.) or project (OSS project,
podcasts, etc.) and/or not posting with a singular purpose or
topic and/or bot accounts.

For specialty acounts: we recognize and have rules around some. If
an account is not a user account and not one of the recognized
account types below, then it is not a type permitted on this
server. This is to prevent automated / single post / corporate
account (etc.) posts from overtaking regular users. If you would
like to create a specialized account type that is not on this
list, please create a suggestion on [our Community Issues on GitHub](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues/new/choose) for a new type of specialized account. Unrecognized
specialized account types will be removed. Recognized account
types that do not follow the rules of their account types will be
moderated as needed.

Some specialized account types are invite only. Unrecognized
specialized accounts that are will be suspended. If
you are interested in creating a specialized account that is
invite only, or not clearly outlined in our docs, you must first reach out to us at
[admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).

For all other specialize accounts, please use the [account approval](#account-approvals) steps below to get formal approval for your account.

#### Note from the Moderation Team

Hachyderm moderators do _not_ proactively attempt to determine your account type. For account types
that are not invite-only, this means that we normally first encounter your account when a user files a report for
a rules violation (either server rules or rules for your perceived account type) unless you have reached out to us first.

We recommend that all specialized accounts reach out to the moderation team at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io),
even if your account type is not invite-only, to assist with expectations setting. 

## User Accounts

User accounts are also referred to as General Accounts, which are
briefly described on our [General Accounts Page](/docs/account-types/general-accounts/).
In general:

- Follow server rules
- Don't create type confusion with a specialized account type

For the latter, if you are an individual user then you shouldn't
have a username or About page that might indicate that you are a
company, project, or other form of specialized account. As a
specific example, if you have an account name like MyUserCompany
or MyPodcast then you will be considered that specialized account
type based on name or About page and be bound by those rules.

### Influencer Accounts = Large Userbase Accounts

Anyone who has more than 25k followers on an existing platform is
what we refer to as an [Influencer Account](/docs/account-types/influencer-accounts/). The only special rule here is
that we request that you reach out to us in advance at
[admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io) before migrating
as we will likely need to assist with the migration to prevent
follows getting "stuck", etc.

## Specialized Accounts

The common rules for all specialized account types are:

- Your username and display name must clearly indicate what you are.
This means for companies, OSS projects, podcasts, newsletters, etc.
then the username must match the company / project name. For most
other account types this means "describe what you are" via username,
e.g. "CuratedTechJobPosts".
- You must be verified with your company, project, etc. page
If your company, project, newsletter, etc. has a web page then
that web page must be verified on your profile.
- Corporate accounts are restricted on this server.
   - As of 1 Mar 2023, corporate accounts will be restricted to Nivenly Corporate Members
   - Prior to 1 Mar 2023, corporate acccounts were invite only
   - All corporate accounts must agree to [the covenant](covenant/)
- All specialized accounts are welcome to [become verified](application/)

### Recognized Specialized Account Categories

* [Corporate](corporate-accounts/) - for businesses, companies, and similar.
* [Events](open-source-accounts/) - for community events, including conferences and meetups.
* [Projects](open-source-accounts/) - for Open Source Projects.
* Curated - these can be accounts that are re-posting / hosting other content, for example a curated
  newsletter, or for individuals that are creating and hosting their own content. Examples of curated
  content can include, but aren't limited to: newsletters, podcasts, and streamers.
* [Automated](bot-accounts/) - most commonly, but not exclusively, bot accounts. Any posts that are programmatic and/or
  scheduled in nature.
* Hybrid - This is when an account falls under more than one category, typically companies, events, projects, etc.
  making use of automated posts. (But not limited to this.) In this case, the account must adhere to all
  the rules for the different types they house.

Of the above, only the [Corporate accounts](corporate-accounts/) are invite-only / require approval. That said,
we do recommend that all specialized accounts reach out to us prior to creating an account so we may assist with
the expectation setting for your account type.

### Disallowed Specialized Account Categories

The following are disallowed as general content on the server, thus are
also disallowed as a dedicated account type.

* NSFW / 18+ - this is mostly due to our need to be able to comply with 18+, which
  isn't in the Mastodon tooling at this time. (See our [Sexual Content Policy](nsfw-policy/) for more information.)
* Fundraising - no accounts can fundraise on Hachyderm.
* Unofficial company / corporate accounts - as this account type is invite only, unapproved
  accounts will be banned.
* Unrecognized specialized account - essentially if you are not a regular user, and not one of the
  explicitly allowed types, you should reach out to [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io)
  prior to making an account.

### Moderation Note

Note that Hachyderm moderators do _not_ proactively attempt to determine your account type. For account types
that are not invite-only, this means that we normally first encounter your account when a user files a report for
a rules violation (either server rules or rules for your perceived account type). We recommend that all
specialized accounts reach out to the moderation team at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).

### Corporate Accounts

An account is considered a "corporate" account if it is a business,
or business-like, entity. This can mean that the account is a business
directly, or that the account is an event -

## Frequently Asked Questions

Below are the FAQ for all Hachyderm accounts.

### Can I post about my company?

Yes. Posting about your company is different from a corporate account. Feel
free to say whatever you want about your company.

### Can I post about my project?

Yes. Posting about your project is different from an open source account. Feel
free to say whatever you want about your project.

### Can I create a bot account?

Not without working directly with the moderators.

### Can I create an anonymous account?

Yes. However, we do not want a single person to operate a high number of
accounts.

We understand the importance of being anonymous from a security, gender,
safety, and mental health perspective.

### Can I create multiple accounts?

Yes. Within reason. We expect you to use your best judgement in not flooding
our servers. We understand you might need more than one account. However, it is
not a free for all.  We understand security, gender, safety, and mental health,
and safe space from work are all reasons to create multiple and anonymous
accounts.

### Can I create accounts for pets, characters, or imaginary friends?

We prefer if you didn't. We are trying to build a curated network of
professionals on Hachyderm and would encourage you to move these accounts to
another instance.
