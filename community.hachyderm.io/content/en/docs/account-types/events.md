  Description of the rules for event accounts.

Events! Look no further. Here are the rules and principles for
our event accounts.

Events may include, but are not limited to:

* Conferences
* Meetups

This account type _only_ applies to community driven events.
Currently, we do not allow separate accounts for corporate events
and/or meetups, although our recognized [corporate accounts](../corporate-accounts/) are
welcome to post about their events.
