In short, we welcome all influencers and have an open door policy to any large
influencer account who would like to make Hachyderm a home.

Welcome all Twitch streamers!

### Large Following Accounts

Earlier this year, [Ian Coldwater](https://hachyderm.io/@ian) joined our
community and with them brought roughly 600 new users in less than an hour.
This unexpected rise in traffic took our team of volunteers off guard and ended
up slowing our service down for the evening.

While we do our best not to let an abrupt traffic spike influence our site, we
also pride ourselves on having a speedy and non-laggy experience for our users.

As a rule if you have more than 25k followers on an existing platform we ask
that you [reach out to us directly](https://hachyderm.io/about/more) via
Discord or email shortly before announcing your transition.

### Self Promotion

We believe that all influencers should be free to promote their brand and their
content on our site, however we have a high bar with regard to product
marketing.

We draw the line between "personal brand" and "corporate account".

In short if you are representing yourself you should be fine to self promote on
Hachyderm.
