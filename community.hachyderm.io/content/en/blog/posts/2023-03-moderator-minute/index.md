Some typing.


FIXME - not 1 Mar.

March Moderator Minute(s)

- How and when to ask things of the mods: individual action vs
  server level
  - When you are reporting off server users to the mods, you are
	requesting server level intervention
  - When you are reporting local server users to the mods, there
	is nuance as there are server rules we can enforce via
	warnings, freezing, etc.
- Moderators are here to handle genuine and manufactured conflict
- As part of launching this post: the self sufficiency (sic) doc,
  or "how to protect your mental health online".
- One of the biggest issues that comes up in moderation space
  frequently, aside from genuine misuse, are conflicts that are
  continuing because _neither party is stepping away_. It's the
  canned message: walk away, you don't even need to announce. If
  they follow you, block, if they are harassing you, report.
  Basically: there needs to be some suggestions here for how users
  can also protect themselves individually, even though there is a
  moderator layer.
