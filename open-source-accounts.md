# Open Source Project Accounts

We welcome open source and collaborate projects, with a few exceptions for projects that operate in a financially biased market or projects that already have financial sponsorship.

### Types of Projects

The following are the types of projects that are welcome to come and go from Hachyderm as they please.
r

 - :heavy_check_mark: Open source software projects with MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, Creative Commons or similiar licenses such as [rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
 - :heavy_check_mark: Open collaborative projects such as [The Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/) or collaborative wiki style projects like [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) and [Wikimedia](https://wikimedia.org). 
 - :heavy_check_mark: Community driven events, open organizations, and volunteer driven events like [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/).
 - :heavy_check_mark: Open source organizations such as [Matrix](https://matrix.org).
 

Unfortunately we are unable to support projects that already have a formal financial funding model that can reasonably afford their own Mastodon infrastructure. 

This includes projects with a structured financial model in place or projects which are active participants in financially biased vendor markets. These would be projects that are funded beyond normal ad-hoc volunteer donations. We encourage these projects to leverage their current funding models for Mastodon support.

 - :heavy_multiplication_x: Financialy biased trade organizations such as the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/about/join/) or [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/membership/) or their subsequent projects such as [Istio](https://www.cncf.io/projects/istio/) or [Helm](https://www.cncf.io/projects/helm/).
 - :heavy_multiplication_x: Funded open source projects with a single corporate sponsor/owners such as Google's [Go Programming language](https://go.dev/) and Hashicorp's [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
 - :heavy_multiplication_x: Funded open source project with structured sponsorship models. Paid services which can only be unlocked via donation such as [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/)'s quota limit which can only be raised via donation.
 - :heavy_multiplication_x: Community edition projects, or "up-sell" projects that resemble a paid service such as [pfSense Community Edition](https://www.pfsense.org/download/).


### What Is Financial Bias?

Our community calls out the concept of financial bias which we define as "the ability for a specific vendor, project, or organiation to pay for a competitive advantage". 
Many vendor markets exist today which allow for wealthier vendors to pay for higher and more attractive sponsorship models that other vendors cannot afford. 

We believe that expensive sponsorship models that promise a higher return of investment with regard to product marketing create an unfair advantage for small businesses. We believe in a level playing field for small businesses and cannot condone this model in our community.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I create an account for my event? Like Devopsdays?

Yes. As long as your event is not a profit focused event you are welcome to create an account. If your event is profit seeking, you must follow our [corporate policy](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/blob/main/corporate-accounts.md).

#### What about Devopsdays for my specific city? 

Yes. As long as your subsidary account isn't repeating the same content as the parent account. We expect each account to have relatively independent content.

### Can I create a support/help/fan/paradoy account?

No. Accounts like "Linux Tips" or "Kubernetes Memes" are not in alignment with our mission to create a curated group of professionals. We aim to have accounts that represent real people.

### Can I create an account if a similar one already exists?

No. We want to have one account for each project. We do not want to have "Wikipedia tips" and "Wikipedia facts" as separate accounts. We think that collaboration of the same account should be shared at the project level. You should join the project and ask for access to the Mastodon account.

### Can I create a bot account for our open source project? 

No. We know its fun to automate pull requests, build status, and more. However we try to keep our content based around real words written by real people.
