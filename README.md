## Rules

See our [official rules](https://hachyderm.io/about/more#rules). 

This is your first and final warning to take our rules seriously.

## Getting Started / Signing Up

 - [Welcome Guide](/welcome/README.md) for Mastodon 101 and getting started.

## Accounts

We identify a few types of accounts that are useful for understanding the minutia for things such as corporate accounts, bot accounts, event accounts, and open source project accounts.

## Moderation 

Our moderators are not the fediverse police.

We expect everyone to understand that our moderators are volunteers who work tirelessly around the clock to keep deliberate bad-actors away from our community.

We don't expect our moderators to also have to chase around our community members who are violating rules or need to be reminded of our policy. 

As a community member if you get on our moderators radar you are likely doing something very offensive.

We believe in patience and understanding. 
There is a good chance that expectations have not been set or a policy has not been made clear.

We will work with you to find a happy path, however if it becomes a pattern we will ask you to leave Hachyderm.
