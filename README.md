# Troubleshooting, Support, and Issues

The most critical thing you can do to help us help you (even more so than a donation) is to **reduce noise**. 

The best way for you to help reduce noise is to leverage our issue tracker instead of independent one-off requests for help. It is a full time job sifting through requests and making sense of them. If you want to help, leverage the issue tracker and [create a new issue](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues/new) or better yet find one that already exists.
