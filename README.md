# The Hachyderm Community

Welcome to the Hachyderm community.

### Mission

## Rules

See our [official rules](https://hachyderm.io/about/more#rules). 

This is your first and final warning to take our rules seriously.

### "Don't Be A Dick" Policy

Hachyderm and its surrounding community have found safety and value in a primary guiding principle, that is often hard to interpret.

> Don't be a dick.

We believe that everyone knows when they are "being a dick", and we do not tolerate this level of aggression towards our community. In short, we believe that you know if you are being a dick, and therefore you should be able to stop. If you do not stop, you will no longer be welcome on Hachyderm.

Being a dick is the opposite of respect. While we allow all opinions to be voiced on Hachyderm, we believe that any opinion can be offered with respect.

We expect all members to be respectful and thus, not be a dick.

## Moderation 

Our moderators are not the fediverse police.

We expect everyone to understand that our moderators are volunteers who work tirelessly around the clock to keep deliberate bad-actors away from our community.

We don't expect our moderators to also have to chase around our community members who are violating rules or need to be reminded of our policy. 

As a community member if you get on our moderators radar you are likely doing something very offensive.

We believe in patience and understanding. 
There is a good chance that expectations have not been set or a policy has not been made clear.

We will work with you to find a happy path, however if it becomes a pattern we will ask you to leave Hachyderm.
