# Rules

See our [official rules](https://hachyderm.io/about/more#rules).

This is your first and final warning to take our rules seriously.

### "Don't Be A Dick" Policy

Hachyderm and its surrounding community have found safety and value in a primary guiding principle, that is often hard to interpret.

> Don't be a dick.

We believe that everyone knows when they are "being a dick", and we do not tolerate this level of aggression towards our community. 

In short, we believe that you know if you are being a dick, and therefore you should be able to stop. If you do not stop, you will no longer be welcome on Hachyderm.

Being a dick is about intent. If your intentions are to hurt, brandish, slander, diminish, insult, or offend someone instead of voicing your opinion you are likely being a dick. We believe our community can do better than that.

Being a dick is the opposite of respect. We believe all "bad takes" on a topic can be voiced with respect.
We hold each member of the community accountable for managing themselves and finding a respectful way of communicating their contrarian views.

We expect all members to be respectful and thus, not be a dick.

### What about "shitposting"?

Oxford dictionary defines shitposting as:

> the activity of posting deliberately provocative or off-topic comments on social media, typically in order to upset others or distract from the main conversation.

In short shitposting is allowed on Hachyderm. 

However, shitposting can easily violate our "don't be a dick policy" if it turns into offensive trolling at the expense of others.

The key factor in distinguishing between shitposting and being a dick is "at the expense of others".

We believe that any time clout, attention, credibility, fortune, or fame is gained "at the expense of others" it is likely close to a violation of our "no colonialism" rule or a violation of our "don't be a dick" policy.

You can shitpost, just not at the expense of others.

# Moderation 

Our moderators are not the fediverse police.

We expect everyone to understand that our moderators are volunteers who work tirelessly around the clock to keep deliberate bad-actors away from our community.

We don't expect our moderators to also have to chase around our community members who are violating rules or need to be reminded of our policy. 

As a community member if you get on our moderators radar you are likely doing something very offensive.

We believe in patience and understanding. 
There is a good chance that expectations have not been set or a policy has not been made clear.

We will work with you to find a happy path, however if it becomes a pattern we will ask you to leave Hachyderm.
