# Frequently Asked Questions

Below are the FAQ for all Hachyderm accounts. 

### Can I post about my company?

Yes. Posting about your company is different from a corporate account. Feel free to say whatever you want about your company.

### Can I post about my project?

Yes. Posting about your project is different from an open source account. Feel free to say whatever you want about your project.

### Can I create a bot account?

Not without working directly with the moderators.

### Can I create an anonymous account? 

Yes. However, we do not want a single person to operate a high number of accounts.

We understand the importance of being anonymous from a security, gender, safety, and mental health perspective.

### Can I create multiple accounts?

Yes. Within reason. We expect you to use your best judgement in not flooding our servers. We understand you might need more than one account. However, it is not a free for all.
We understand security, gender, safety, and mental health, and safe space from work are all reasons to create multiple and anonymous accounts.

### Can I create accounts for pets, characters, or imaginary friends?

We prefer if you didn't. We are trying to build a curated network of professionals on Hachyderm and would encourage you to move these accounts to another instance.
