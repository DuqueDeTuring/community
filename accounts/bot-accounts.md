# Bots on Hachyderm

Bots come in a wide variety of frequencies and topic spaces. To
limit which bot accounts are posting on our server, bot accounts
must be approved to join. Although bot accounts are not
necessarily corporate accounts, and those that are would fall
under the rules described in [Corporate
Accounts](corporate-accounts.md), there are a few common threads
between them copied in below:

### 1. Be a Hachydermian: Fines Doubled In Work Zone

Bots, like corporate accounts, are held to a higher standard.

### 2. Be the bot you want to work with

Essentially: don't post content either by type or frequency that
_you_ wouldn't want on your timeline if you weren't running the
bot.

### 3. "We know it when we see it" policy

We will moderate bot accounts as they are reported and apply our
best judgement.


### 4. Moderators are volunteers

We will be moderating the bot accounts in a way that does not
create undue burnden on our volunteer mod team.

If you would like the longer descriptions of the above,
please take a look at our [Corporate Accounts](corporate-accounts.md)
which spells these out in more detail.

## Limited Accounts

Although not a watertight rule, for bots in general:

- All bots must select the bot checkbox in their profile settings
  <br /> ![](../assets/mastodon-bot-account.png)
- Most bots that are on topic, that is to say IT relevant,
  will typically be Limited. This means people can follow you, but
  your content will not be on Local / Federated timelines.
- To help with Discovery, we'll keep a list of Approved Bots in our docs
- Bots that violate rules about spam, fundraising, 18+, corporate, etc.
  account types will be suspended.
