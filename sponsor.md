# Sponsorships

If you are interested in learning about and possibly becoming an official Hachyderm sponsor you are in the right place.

A sponsorship is different than a donation because a sponsorship comes with special privileges to advertise on hachyderm. 
At any time you can [donate](https://ko-fi.com/krisnovalive) directly to our cause without the need of a sponsorship or an application process. 
If you would like to donate, you can do so at any time with no extra work.

### What is a sponsorship?

A sponsorship is a one-time agreement between you and the folks operating Hachyderm that allows you to solicit product marketing content within the agreed upon time window for your sponsorship.

### How much does it cost?

We are charging $300 a month and recommend a minimum of 3 months and no more than 9 months for the duration.

### What do I get?

If you are accepted as a sponsor you will be given access to share your brand and your services directly on the hachyderm.io mastodon instance.

You will also recieve dedicated shout-outs and engagement directly from the [Kris Nóva](https://twitch.tv/krisnova) Twitch channel. 
We will produce several real-time recordings of looking at and in some cases using your service live on the air. 
Any swag or promotional material sent out will be included in the twitch streams.

Yourself and Kris Nóva will work directly together to find language, demos, and content that makes you both feel great about the sponsorship.

### What can I do with it?

Once the sponsorship has been accepted, you are welcome to share your content as freely as you like.

We suggest no more than 3 promotional posts a day, and we suggest no more than 3 days of the work week for promotional content for best engagement.

### What can I not do with it?

This is not a free-ride to say whatever you want or spam our audience. You should feel proud of your brand, and it should be tastefully done. 

Only you and our moderators can determine where "spam" starts and stops, but we believe everyone knows when it occurs.

### What is considered "Product" and "Marketing"

The easiest way to determine if your content is product marketing is to ask yourself if your questionable content is intended for you, or the organization you represent to **profit**. 
Every corporation in the U.S. and in many countries around the world are centered around the quest for profit. If you are sending messages designed to increase profit, you are likely product marketing. 

The best way to learn about product and marketing is to review our rules on [spam](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/blob/main/spam.md#hard-rules). 
While a sponsorship will not allow you to send repeated messages, it will allow you to circumvent our rules on profit-seeking content.

### How do I apply?

Open up a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues/new) and include the following. 
 
 1. Name of the brand or services you intend on promoting.
 2. Links to other promotions or product marketing you have done in the past.
 3. Examples of language and posts you intend on sharing both on Hachyderm and on Twitch.
 4. Link to your existing social media sites, and include any social media you might reference.

### How do I pay?

You can work directly with [Kris Nóva](https://github.com/krisnova) or pay diretly through the [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/krisnovalive) application.
