<h1>Our Moderators and Infrastructure Maintainers</h1>

<p>Hachyderm is moderated by a team of volunteers. The moderation team has a variety of backgrounds to allow them to understand the lived experiences of as many of our users as possible. The moderation team also makes a commitment to learn and grow to allow them to understand, as best as possible, the lived experiences of others who are different from themselves.</p>

<p>We follow diplomatic and anarchist rules where applicable. We also have <a href="https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/">Community documentation</a> to help all of our users know what to expect when interacting on Hachyderm.</p>


<p>Similarly, Hachyderm's infrastructure team is comprised of people with a diverse set of domain area expertise, lived experiences, and geographies. By their powers combined we are able to run a scaled Mastodon instance!</p>

<p>The most recent volunteer application cycle was Nov-Dec 2022 with follow-ups happening in Jan 2023 (and likely a few more in Feb 2023). There will be future requests for volunteers as we're still growing!</p>

<h1>Reporting Issues and Reaching the Mods</h1>

<p>
If you are looking to reach the mods for any reason, e.g. service latency or outages, emoji requests, requests to add domains to our blocklist, etc. we are reachable on our <a href="https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues">GitHub Community Repo Issue Tracker</a>.
</p>

<p>
A few things to note:
<ul>
<li>Please do not [at] nova or the mods specifically. Due to scale, lots of noise is generated this way.<br />(There is no penalty if you do, it's just hard to track and respond to efficiently.)</li>
<li>Note that some issues stay open for longer than others. That is because there is a mixture of direct actions like "please upload this emoji" and rules / topics to converse about that are more "can we talk about X / I have feedback about X" style issues.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Specialized / Entity Accounts</h1>

<p>Although regular user accounts are only subject to regular server rules, specialized / entity / "novelty" / "focus" accounts have some additional restrictions. To learn more, please see our <a href="https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/account-types/">accounts doc page</a>. A short summary of what to know:
<ul>
<li>Company, company-like, and/or business accounts, currently known as corporate accounts, are invite only. Unofficial corporate accounts will be suspended.</li>
  <ul><li>Anyone looking to create an account of this type must reach out to the admin team at <a href="mailto:admin@hachyderm.io">admin@hachyderm.io</a>.</li></ul>
<li>Those looking to create accounts for non-profit entities should reach out to the admin team at <a href="mailto:admin@hachyderm.io">admin@hachyderm.io</a>.</li>
<li>Bot accounts are allowed with restrictions (please see the doc).
</li>
<li>Qualifying Open Source Project accounts are allowed (please see the doc).
</li>
<li><b>Essentially: anyone interested in creating an account that is not a general user should reach out to the admin team at <a href="mailto:admin@hachyderm.io">admin@hachyderm.io</a>.</b></li>
<li>Large / Influencer account set ups and transfers, which is defined as more than 10k on any platform, need to reach out to the Admin team prior to transfer at <a href="mailto:admin@hachyderm.io">admin@hachyderm.io</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that Hachyderm moderators will not proactively try to determine your account category. If you do not reach out to the mods, the most common way the mods become aware of your account is via a user report for a rule violation for your perceived or assumed account type.</p>

<p>Unrecognized specialized account types will be suspended. Commonly suspended / unrecognized subtypes are:
<ul>
<li>NSFW / 18+
</li>
<li>Fundraising
</li>
<li>Unofficial company / corporate accounts
</li>
</ul>
This is not an exhaustive list. If you are unsure if the specific specialized account you have in mind is allowed, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:admin@hachyderm.io">admin@hachyderm.io</a>.
