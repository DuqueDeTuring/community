#Funding

Hachyderm is currently running on donations to [Kris N√≥va's Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/krisnovalive) page; however, we are in the process of setting up a new process that is more accessible / does not require separate account creation.

#Moderation and Community Safety

Hachyderm is actively moderated to protect our most vulnerable members. Our primary rule is Don't Be A Dick and all other rules are to capture common "whataboutisms" that we want to clearly state are included by Don't Be A Dick. [Our server rules](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/rule-explainer/), including Don't Be A Dick, are explained on our Community Docs.

When making moderation decisions, our moderators abide by [our Moderator Covenant](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/moderation/covenant/). This is to both hold ourselves accountable as well as provide transparency, and build community trust, around how we handle issues that might appear to fall into "grey areas".

If you experience an issue that needs moderator action / intervention, please look at our documentation page for [how to report issues to the moderators](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/moderation/reporting/).
